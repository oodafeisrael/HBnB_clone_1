This is a team project developed by Israel and Yonela Mphini. This project is called the AirBnB clone - console project. It si a command interpreter to manage the  AirBnB objects. It is our first step towards building our first full web application. The command interpreter (the console) is a command-line interface where we can interact with the objects of our web application by entering commands and receiving output.
